Description: 
    This implements the Brunton et al (2016; PNAS) sparse
    identification algorithm for finding ordinary differential
    equations for a measured system from raw data (SINDy). The library
    includes a set of additional tools for working with raw
    data, with an emphasis on cognitive science applications.
