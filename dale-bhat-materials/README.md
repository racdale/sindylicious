# Dale and Bhat (submitted): Data and Code

Code to go with Dale and Bhat (submitted). Equations of mind: Data science for inferring differential equations.

Code is organized by figure (where primary results are shown in the paper).

The `sindyr::sindy` and other functions are taken from the `sindyr` library, and must be installed prior to running the code obviously.
