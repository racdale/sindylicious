# Dale and Bhat (submitted): Data and Code

Code to go with:

> Dale and Bhat (submitted). Equations of mind: Data science for inferring nonlinear dynamics of socio-cognitive systems.

Code is organized by demonstrations in the paper. HTML renderings of the markdown should allow for easy perusing of the application of SINDy through the library `sindyr`. The `sindy` and other functions are taken from the `sindyr` library, and must be installed prior to running this code.
