# Dale and Bhat (submitted): Data and Code

Code to go with:

> Dale and Bhat (submitted). Equations of mind: Data science for inferring ODEs for socio-cognitive systems.

Code is organized by figure (where primary results are shown in the paper). HTML renderings of the markdown should allow for easy perusing of the application of SINDy through the library `sindyr`. The `sindy` and other functions are taken from the `sindyr` library, and must be installed prior to running the code obviously.
