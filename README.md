## Tools for Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics with R

`sindyr` is an R library for inferring ordinary differential equations from raw data, based on SINDy by Brunton et al. (2016). The library also extends this method in several ways, including a sliding window tool that generates descriptive measures of a system from SINDy.

If you use the code, toss us a shout out by citing:

Dale, R. & Bhat, H. (submitted). Equations of mind: Data science for inferring differential equations.

Under "Dale and Bhat Paper Materials," we show several example uses of `sindyr`, based on the manuscript cited above.
